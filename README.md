#OntopChallenge

## Challenge:

In the following Figma link [Figma Ontop](https://www.figma.com/file/l1IcP1dvCDLmlwBMRkJyY9/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) there are 2 screens of the Ontop platform.

- Please, review this figma and leave your feedback on what you think could improve the design.

- After cloning this project, your task will be to make sure that both screens in Angular are
  completely the same as Figma (pixel perfect web design).

- You are free to modify this project to your liking and use any external library you want (Bootstrap, Material, etc).

## Deliverable:

- We need you to upload what you have done to a Github repository so that we can review it, based on your results
  We will schedule another meeting to continue the process.

Some additional considerations:

In this Challenge we want to see your ability to realize the differences between Angular mockups
and Figma so the deliverable should not have any special functionality as that is not the goal of this step.

If you have any kind of question, do not hesitate to write to us, we are very attentive to help you!

We hope to have you in our team ðŸ˜º, regards~!.
